Here is the Dotnet project for airport management, in which we have implemented the Entity Framework, service layer, and web layer. The Entity Framework is used for efficient database interactions, ensuring seamless data management and retrieval. The service layer contains the business logic and operations, making the system modular and scalable. The web layer provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust and maintainable solution for managing airport operations effectively.
